Mocka (Racket Impl) | Data Generation Programming Language
======
This is the original codebase for the Mocka Programming language.  
Although this implementation works, it's not very fast and also lacks proper portability.  


There is an ongoing effort to port this language to rust, [which can be found here](https://github.com/PrestonSam/mocka).
